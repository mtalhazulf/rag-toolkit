export const SAMPLE_TEXT = `Text chunking is a technique used in natural language processing to break down large texts into smaller, more manageable pieces. This is particularly useful for tasks like summarization, translation, and semantic analysis.
There are several approaches to text chunking:
1. Fixed-length chunking divides text into equal-sized pieces.
2. Sentence-based chunking uses sentence boundaries as natural dividers.
3. Paragraph-based chunking respects paragraph structure.
4. Sliding window creates overlapping chunks for context preservation.
5. Semantic chunking groups text by thematic relevance.
Each method has its own advantages and use cases depending on the specific requirements of the application.`;
